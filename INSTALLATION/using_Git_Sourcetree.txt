# create the repo on bit-bucket

# Configure Git for the first time
git config --global user.name "Das Sreetama (other detail)"
git config --global user.email "Sreetama.Das@xxxxcom"


# to clone a new repo on local system,
# While cloning using sourcetree, you can select destination path (on local system) - this should be an empty folder
# if using git, cd to the appropriate folder & type the following:
cd existing-project
git clone https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/~id/test1.git


# if you already have code ready to be pushed to this repository 
# Sourcetree: add new files in the project folder on local. They are automatically shown in sourcetree.
# stage & commit, then push to appropriate repo
# in git bash, do the following:
cd existing-project
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/~id/test1.git
git push -u origin master



# if we need to clone a specific branch of the repo , & add our updates
# Select respective branch you’ll be working with: Main Menu > Repository > Checkout... > Checkout New Branch tab > then select the branch on bit-bucket
# or we can create a fork. Then in sourcetree, we can see the corresponding branch
# else, type the following in git bash
cd localSystem/projectA_forkedBranchB
git clone https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/ParentProject/projectA.git  --branch branchB
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add projectA https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/ParentProject/projectA.git
git push -u projectA branchB



# If your code is already tracked by Git then set this repository as your "origin" to push to.
cd existing-project
git remote set-url origin https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/~id/test1.git
git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags



# if multiple people are working on a repo:
1. Create a fork from the master repository ("golden master") under your name - this will reflect in personal bitbucket  ("local master"). 

2. Once forked you will now have your own copy of the master code. It is advisable to "pull" from the master branch of golden repository 
   every morning into your own forked repository to avoid conflicts during code merge and to ensure that the code you write does not cause
   errors when merged with golden repository code. 
   
3. Once forked you will have the latest code under your respective ID/ personal bitbucket  ("local master").
   Clone it to your local system using Sourcetree or Git cmd.
   # git config --global user.name "Das Sreetama (other detail)"
   # git config --global user.email "Sreetama.Das@xxxxcom"
   # git clone https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/~id/test1.git
    
   
4. Once you have made changes on the local system, it is time to commit and push the changes to your local repository. 
   Try maintaining two branches in your local: one is for Master and one Development. 
   In Source tree: move files from Unstaged to Staged for commit 
   Then "commit" , add comments
   then push to your own repo ("local master")
   
   cd existing-project
   git init
   git add --all
   git commit -m "Initial Commit"
   git remote add projectA https://sourcecode.socialcodingx.com/scm/~id/projectA.git
   git push -u projectA master

   
5.	Once you have validated the changes on your bit bucket, Create a pull request to the Golden Repository.
    Source is your personal repository and Destination is the golden repository.
    Press Continue and the request will go to reviewer for approval who will check for all conflicts and thereafter approve the pull request 
    
6. raise merge request to merge with master branch
