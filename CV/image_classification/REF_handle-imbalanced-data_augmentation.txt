which numbers are too low & require treatment?



strategies: 
1. offline data augmentation:
   https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1175177461920698368  oversampling is supposed to work better than class weights

2.class-weighted loss functions : modify the loss function to have more weightage for the smaller class

3. imbalanced data sampling - same as point 2
    https://github.com/ufoym/imbalanced-dataset-sampler    (this works by assigning class weights - same as above)

4. Early stopping:
    https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/09/19/understanding-regularization-for-image-classification-and-machine-learning/
    

5. You can also explore changing learning rate, as in fastai tutorials.


6. Creating multiple hierarchical models to balance the dataset, in this case good vs rest, then defect1 vs rest, then defect2 vs defect3 


7. check how to change probability thresholds in fastai, to change the class assignments? - may not be feasible / useful for multiclass

8. progressive re-sizing – the images are large & some of the defects are small. Re-sizing images may be leading to information loss.

###   Data augmentation for object detection 
  - needs to ensure bbox information is correctly updated when transforms (involving changes to object locations/ orientations) are applied
need to see: generalising for different bbox formats ; saving the transformed image & bbox coordinates
