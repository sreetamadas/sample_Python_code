## background to image pre-processing
Basic image pre-processing
    Differences in illumination across captured images
    Sizes
    Shape – square vs rectangle
Feature extraction from CNNs
Handling imbalanced data sets – save augmented images?
Type of augmentations to apply (flip, rotate, crop, jitter, etc)
Image labeling?
Checking for duplicates
Use of un-supervised approaches?
Greyscaling color images – is this same as normalization?
Choice of image size for network, apart from pre-specified size

note:
most of the existing algorithms train fast with smaller image sizes (in the range of 200 x 200 to 416 x 416 , etc.) 
- this may lead to loss of small features when images are resized to small dimensions
most algorithms work with square images





## Following are the pre-processing methods we can apply.
Image resizing
RGB -> Gray scale
Image normalization
K-means clustering (
    noise removal,  
    Remove unnecessary details
SLIC super pixel segmentation – some values from each segment – use these as features to ML (RF, SVM, etc)
Histogram modification
    Histogram equalization – improve contrast (no apriori idea about good images)
    Histogram modification – improve quality/contrast of target images using histogram of contrast from good images
Edge detection for segmentation (Canny edge detection)
For segmentation without labelled info – region growing methods
Image filters 
    High pass- Laplacian filter
    Low pass- mean filter, Gaussian, median
    edge detection filters (Sobel, etc)



For large images:
1. try progressive resizing during training, 
2. crop the original large image into multiple segments, predict on each crop & get consensus prediction (class or list of bounding boxes)

For rectangular images:
1. pad the smaller dimension
2. crop the larger image into multiple square images
3. crop into multiple sections & pad to make square
